Desmos is a great math tool, but people also make some insane math art on it. 

Of course I've dabbled in it too, here is a picture of a duck I made in Desmos:

Think that's impressive? It's time for myself to be humbled. Here is a gallery of some of my favorite art pieces for the Desmos Art Competition 2023. You can find more on the [official site.](https://www.desmos.com/art)

Here is a really cool picture of the Hudson River. [This one is created by Richard He](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/nkwvtfuv99):

This one is actually a piano playing some music! You can do this through the \"play graph\" feature desmos offers. [This piece is by Nick Ertman](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/yvchjdew6g):

This one is a really, really impressive drawing (or calculation) of a nighttime diner. [This is created by Judy Luo](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/1cwbqzjqjm):

And last for this post, this one is a 3D model of a piano that also plays some music: Clair de Lune by Claude DeBussy. [This was made by Audrey Chiang](https://www.desmos.com/3d/4fe020e052):

Once again this was all Desmos! I couldn't even do this with an actual paintbrush! Really amazing how these creative people managed to do it with mathematical equations. Once again, this stuff is really really cool!

Go check them out in the gallery! I'll see you in another post!
