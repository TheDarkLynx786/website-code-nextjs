Following the game soundtrack I made and the volume control experiments I was undertaking, I decided to undertake a composition series that depicted the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.

Oh, and did I mention it was metal?

Once again I was playing around with the same musical scale, nothing new there, but my experience from the previous music tracks that I made had taught me a lot about volume control, and I ended up making some great metal-sounding tracks that didn't sacrifice sound quality to maintain the distorted metal guitar sound. 

I am still releasing a few tracks, so keep a lookout for them! I'll make an update post for when the whole project is finished.
