This post is made to advertise Dermalyze, a machine learning project me and a [friend](https://cyberneel.com) created that analyzes skin conditions through a machine learning model. Though the model was mostly programmed by my friend, I did a lot of the website design and social media post desiging, and it took off! We took it to hackathons and are entering it into the Congressional App Challenge, which we hope to win. You can go support us at our [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dermalyze/), and our [website](https://dermalyze.tech/) (which you can also go check out through the links page).

Also, stating the obvious, if you have a skin condition, please go test our project! We would love to hear feedback about what we made.

Through this experience, I'm likely going to create a machine learning project of my own, as I've learned a lot through this experience. You can even see that I reused the website theme for our project site for my own lol. Keep an eye out for more posts to see what I'm going to be up to in the (hopefully) near future.
