# I am Murtaza Haque!
As a disciple of the computing arts (computer scientist), I welcome you to my finely-crafted JavaScript and CSS mound.  
<br>
I develop small solvers, video games, websites, machine learning models, and I am continuing to expand my skillset in this growing world of fascinating new gadgets and gizmos.
<br>
Oh but that's not all I do.
<br>
I am also pretty involved with mathematics, and you would occasionally catch me solving calculus problem or an induction proof.
<br>
I am a musician as well! I play any percussive instrument, as well as guitar and maybe piano.
Best part, I make my own music! I throw down my theory knowledge on DAWs and sometimes they turn into bangers. Go listen to some of my music here (insert link here when I make the music page)!
<br>
Seems like I'm pretty interesting, maybe you should follow me or something on my socials? (linked below)


## So why choose computer science?
