# I am Murtaza Haque!
As a budding technomancer and disciple of the computing arts (computer scientist), I welcome you to my finely-crafted JavaScript and CSS mound.  
<br>
I develop small solvers, video games, websites, other types of software, machine learning models, and I love to play around with the fun new tools and technologies that keep rapidly developing.
<br>
Oh but that's not all I do.
<br>
I am also pretty involved with mathematics, and you would occasionally catch me solving a calculus problem or an induction proof.
<br>
I am a musician as well! I play any percussive instrument, as well as guitar and maybe piano.
Best part, I make my own music! I throw down my theory knowledge on DAWs and sometimes they turn into bangers. Go listen to some of my music [here](/music/)!
<br>
Seems like I'm pretty interesting, maybe you should follow me or something on my socials? (linked in the footer)


## So why choose computer science?

Logic is fun. Solving puzzles are fun. Each step of a problem presents itself with another sub-problem, and each battle won in the war makes you feel like a conquerer. And of course, each project makes you feel like a grand architect.
<br>
This seems like a good reason to go into something like proofwriting or theoretical physics. You would be right, as I was indeed thinking about it.
<br>
However, the great thing about computers is that they encompass logic-based fields such as these: proficiency with computers can therefore extend your proficiency in fields like math or physics, given you are familiar with the flavor of each subject. Learning how to work with computers teaches not just how to *use* logic to solve problems, but how to *process* the logic itself (e.i. through algorithms).
<br>
And of course, computers have their own flavor too. The science, technology, and tools behind both hardware and software are fascinating, and learning to use them unlocks great creative potential. They have also started to teach themselves, and sooner or later, they will be teaching us, if they have already not.
<br>
I could advertise this field to you all day. Real talk, I just wanted to make my own video games. ;)

# So what can you expect to find on this website?

Consider this site like my digital archive of some sort. I'm going to have quite a few things, including but not limited to:

* Articles on various topics related to my interests, of course, curated by yours truly
* The music I produce (go give it a listen)!
* A contact page, so you can offer feedback, ideas, conspiracy theories, confessions, etc.
* A page where I showcase my programming projects (I'll post devlogs normally)
* A link to my portfolio, for professional purposes.
* Links to other socials and good people you should totally check out!

Scram, give Vercel a bad time, and me SEO boosts!
