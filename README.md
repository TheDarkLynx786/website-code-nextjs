# Murtaza Haque's Personal Website

Welcome to my finely-crafted JavaScript and CSS mound!

## So what's this site for?

A bunch of things! I make music, so it's a place to host all my compositions. There's also:
- Posts
- Posts about omelettes?
- Posts about math?
- Programming Projects (coming soon)
- Contact Page (Resend setup soon)
- and much more (plenty to also come soon)

Also, this site is a revamp from my previous site which I had setup using Hugo (the SSG) and GitHub Pages. 
It was time for an upgrade, and I went all out (or as all out as I could go at the time, more to come soon!)

## Tech n Stuff

Well, what do you expect, it's mostly NextJS and stuff.

But there are some more things in there:
- I made my own system where markdown files get converted to HTML, so I can write posts in markdown but have them rendered with custom styles and everything (very cool!)
- I have a bunch of data in JSON files which are used to fetch info for my music files
  - There is also a Python file that generates some of this information
- Cool visualizers that take frequency data from music and display it!!
- Custom Music player!!

Yeah that's about it, not too technical you can get with a website lol
